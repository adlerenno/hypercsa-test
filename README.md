# hypercsa-test

his repository contains the [Snakefile](https://snakemake.github.io) to perform the tests of the [IBB]() paper. 
The snakefile will download all necessary repositories, 
install all necessary libraries ([SDSL](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite), [divsufsort](https://github.com/y-256/libdivsufsort/tree/master)) 
and download the test datasets from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/). 
The order of steps might differ due to order in which the rules are performed, which can vary. 


## Preparation

Install [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io), 
you can of course use any package systems for installation.
Clone this GitHub project then:

## Data sets

This project contains most of the tested data sets. They are publicly available, but not downloadable via script (if you know a way, we would be happy to include them not directly in this repository.) Thus, we provide a table of links here that point to the origin of these data sets.

| Data set                     | Origin |
